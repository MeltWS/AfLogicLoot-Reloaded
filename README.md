When there's group loot in dungeons you can now let this addon automatically select »need« or »greed«.

Just open the configuration window once and define on which kind of loot what should be selected. There are multiple categories to choose from to adjust the looting behaviour to your own needs.

After installation you can configure it by typing `/afloot` in any chat window or using the ESC-Menu.
